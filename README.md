<p align="justify"> <b><i>DISCLAIMER:</i></b> This project was solely developed by myself for the class of Sensor Networks. I have translated the python code presented in proj-code folder. All the images that I provide will appear in text in portuguese. Some items may appear partially finished. </p>

<h2> Description: </h2>
<p align="justify"> The objective of this project was to create a LoRaWAN node based on a LoPy board that would be able to communicate to The Things Network platform and then send the data to a dashboard, the data was acquired with a Pysense 2.0 X. Additionally I decided to add extra functionalities to the project, like communication redundancy either through LoRaWAN network or WiFi network and also partial configuration (very simple, just as a proof of concept) of the node through BLE advertising. </p>
